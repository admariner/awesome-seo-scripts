# awesome-seo-scripts

I write a lot of random code around SEO and want to make more of it public in 2020.

**If you have an idea, but not sure how to code it, hit me up [@johnmurch](https://www.twitter.com/johnmurch) on twitter**

## Archive.org
This script allows you to download all the URLs from a given URL.

``` cd archive.org && npm install ```
``` node fetch.js https://www.domain.com```

## Puppeteer Redirect
This script reads URLs from urls.txt (One URL Per Line) and checks for redirects using Puppeteer

``` cd puppeteer-redirect && npm install ```
``` node puppeteer-redirect.js```
